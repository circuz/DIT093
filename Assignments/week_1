1. Combinatorics

1. 99!
2. 6, (39*38)/2, n(n-1)/2
3. engineering = 11 letters = 11! ways to order but 2 g's, 2 i's, 3 e's and 3 n's so we divide by 2!*2!*3!*3! = 144 to remove any overcounting: 11!/144

2. Asymptotic Order

The only questionable one here is f4 = n^100 vs f7 = n^log n as n will eventually get bigger but these numbers are so ludicrously
n(log n)^2
n^1.5
n^100
n^(log n)
4^n
2^n^2
2^2^n
